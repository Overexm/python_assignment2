Bitcoin
 The very first cryptocurrency was  Bitcoin. Since it is open source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency. Many people have done exactly this. Some of these coins are very similar to Bitcoin, with just one or two amended features (such as Litecoin), while others are very different, with varying models of security, issuance and governance. However, they all share the same moniker — every coin issued after Bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin. 
 ICO stands for initial coin offering. Many of the smaller projects in the crypto space — and a few of the largest ones — raised money from private investors around the world in the crypto equivalent of a crowdfunding campaign. Investors would send funds — usually in the form of Bitcoin — to the project and receive coin or tokens in return. Most ICOs happened in 2017 and early 2018 and used Ethereum as a platform of operation via the ERC-20 standard. In 2018, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarified their rules relating to fundraising for assets, which made it much harder for new cryptocurrency projects to issue their own tokens in this way. Since the appearance of the SEC guidance and the organization’s heightened interest in regulating ICOs for U.S. citizens, the number of ICOs has been reduced substantially.
